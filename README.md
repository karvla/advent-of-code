# Advent of Code

This is where I store my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.
For the most part I solve them early in the morning after waking up (but probably not as soon as they are released in my time zone).

I try to solve them as fast as possible and I don't spend any time cleaning them afterwards:)
